# StarFox64

This is our recreation of [StarFox64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox_64) using Unity and C# as part of our [Videogame](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/VJ) course. We included two custom levels and implemented some mechanics like the barrel roll and different types of attacks.
